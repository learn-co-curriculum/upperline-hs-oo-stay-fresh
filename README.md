+ PRACTICE! Use object orientation to solve the problems at [CodeWars](http://www.codewars.com) and [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

+ Keep working through [RubyMonk](https://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1-ruby-primer) tutorials and problems.

+ BUILD! Pick real world objects and systems and build ruby models that simulate them!

+ Brush your teeth.
